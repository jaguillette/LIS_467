				<p>Hi, I'm Jeremy Guillette. This is a website that I'm making for LIS 467: Web Development. 
					I'm going to write a bit about myself.</p>
				<h1>Too Many Jobs</h1>
				<p>I'm currently working at Simmons College as a Usability Research Assistant, Technology 
					Reference Assistant, and Graduate Assistant. I'm also working as a Library Assistant at 
					Wolbach Library, the library for the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Maybe 
					someday I'll be able to do more than assist people a lot, but currently that's what I do.</p>
				<h1>Bicycling</h1>
				<p>I bike as my primary form of transportation. I started when I moved to Boston, and I haven't
					stopped. My girlfriend actually introduced me to city biking, and now we bike everywhere.</p>
				<h2>Things I like about biking:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Getting everywhere faster, because traffic doesn't exist for me.</li>
					<li>Not feeling like I have to go to the gym, since transportation is excercise.</li>
					<li>Never having to wait for a bus to arrive.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>It's going to be great.</p>

				<p>Hi, I'm Jeremy Guillette. This is a website that I'm making for LIS 467: Web Development. 
					I'm going to write a bit about myself.</p>
				<h1>Too Many Jobs</h1>
				<p>I'm currently working at Simmons College as a <a href="http://gslis.simmons.edu/usability/">Usability Research Assistant</a>, 
					<a href="http://www.simmons.edu/gslis/for/current/tech/">Technology Reference Assistant</a>, and Graduate 
					Assistant to <a href="http://www.simmons.edu/gslis/faculty/fulltime/saunders.php">Laura Saunders</a> and 
					<a href="http://www.simmons.edu/gslis/faculty/fulltime/tang.php">Rong Tang</a>. I'm also working as a 
					Library Assistant at <a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/lib/">Wolbach Library</a>. Maybe 
					someday I'll be able to do more than assist people a lot, but currently that's what I do.</p>
				<h1>Bicycling</h1>
				<p>I bike as my primary form of transportation. I started when I moved to Boston, and I haven't
					stopped. My girlfriend actually introduced me to city biking, and now we bike everywhere.</p>
				<h2>Things I like about biking:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Getting everywhere faster, because traffic doesn't exist for me.</li>
					<li>Not feeling like I have to go to the gym, since transportation is excercise.</li>
					<li>Never having to wait for a bus to arrive.</li>
				</ul>
				<h1>Internet stuff</h1>
				<p>I've been a pretty internet-based person for a while, starting with <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">StumbleUpon</a> in 
					undergrad, which has now progressed into an addiction to <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>. I'm not a big fan of 
					social media (if I wanted to talk to people, why would I be online?), but I've found it 
					to be a really helpful way of learning things I wouldn't know otherwise. For example, have 
					you ever heard the story of the the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1904_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_marathon">1904 Olympics Men's Marathon</a>?
					It's one of the most hilarious Wikipedia articles I've ever read, and I found out about it 
					from Reddit.</p>
				<h1>Board Games</h1>
				<p>I'm kind of a board game geek. I played a good amount of Dungeons and Dragons in college,
					and it seems that complicated board games come with the territory. These days I'm not 
					involved in any D&amp;D campaigns, but I do find time to play stuff like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixit_(card_game)">Dixit</a>, 
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)">Dominion</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxx">Fluxx</a>, and 
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchkin_(card_game)">Munchkin</a>.</p>
